## INTRODUCTION

This library enables members of the ATtiny family to become Slaves on an I2C Bus. The library is based on a hardware implementation of I2C which is faster than the software one, but requriesusing a specific set of pins for SDA (PA6) & SCL (PA4).

## GENERAL NOTES

This library follows the convetions of the Arduino's built-in [Wire](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire) library, with only 'TinyWireS' replacing the 'Wire' keyword. Hence, for example, use TinyWireS.begin(SLAVE_ADDR) to join the I2C Bus as Slave, or TinyWireS.write(dataByte) to send a data byte to the Master.
